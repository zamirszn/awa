Collab - A Not Just Dev Hackathon Community App 

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, community bonds are often weakened as individuals become engrossed in their daily routines. Despite living in the same neighborhoods, people may not be aware of the vibrant local events and opportunities available to them. Traditional methods of event discovery and community engagement are often fragmented and lack a centralized platform.

This challenge is further compounded by the fact that local event organizers and community members may face difficulties in promoting and participating in events. There is a need for a comprehensive solution that not only connects residents with the richness of their local community but also empowers event organizers to reach a wider audience.

### Key Challenges

1. **Fragmented Information:** Local events are scattered across various platforms, making it challenging for residents to discover and engage in activities happening in their immediate vicinity.

2. **Limited Awareness:** Many community members may not be aware of the diverse events occurring around them, leading to missed opportunities for social interaction, personal growth, and community involvement.

3. **Organizer Visibility:** Event organizers, especially those from smaller community groups, often struggle to reach a broader audience and attract participants due to limited promotional resources.

4. **Community Engagement:** The lack of a unified platform for community engagement hinders the development of a strong sense of belonging and shared experiences among residents.

## Proposed Solution

Our community-focused app aims to bridge these gaps by providing a centralized platform for local event discovery, promotion, and participation. Through intuitive features such as event calendars, interactive maps, and real-time notifications, residents can easily explore, join, and even organize events in their neighborhood. The app's inclusive design encourages community members to actively participate, fostering stronger bonds and a sense of pride in their local area.
